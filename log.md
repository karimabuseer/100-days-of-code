# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 5th July, 2021
##### First gemfiles and code reviews

**Today's Progress**: Wrote my first code review for another Makers student, made my first gemfile + Bundler and worked on the Oystercard challenge.

**Thoughts:** I needed to take a look at a few examples for the gemfile to click, but I got there. I need to look at examples of the kinds of grouping you might want to do for various gems.

### Day 2: 6th July, 2021
##### Extract Class Refactoring and Domain Modelling

**Today's Progress**: Today was a tough yet productive day. We had a long workshop where we focused on domain modelling; particularly class diagraming. This is definitely useful at drawing out rough code structures from user stories, so you can stay close to spec. I then spent about 4 hours working on the Oystercard challenge. We made good progress and I almost have it finished several days early.

**Thoughts:** Extract class refactoring when you have a HUGE class can be tough. You have to think carefully about what methods you want to draw out, and how you're going to change your testing framework (and fix you tests!). Whilst this challenge has forced our hand on this, it's also really helped me establish that it's better to start with a solid idea of various classes that you'll need, as opposed to being forced to draw them out (painfully) once you've already made a BIG class, with a tonne of methods and instance vars.
