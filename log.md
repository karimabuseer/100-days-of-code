# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 5th July, 2021
##### First gemfiles and code reviews

**Today's Progress**: Wrote my first code review for another Makers student, made my first gemfile + Bundler and worked on the Oystercard challenge.

**Thoughts:** I needed to take a look at a few examples for the gemfile to click, but I got there. I need to look at examples of the kinds of grouping you might want to do for various gems.
